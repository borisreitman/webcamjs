NOTE: You don't need anything in the "flash" directory unless you are trying to edit the ActionScript code and rebuild the Flash movie from source. WebcamJS works out of the box in your browser, just grab "webcam.js" and "webcam.swf" for everything you need. The "flash" directory is the raw Flash ActionScript source only, which is not needed at runtime.
